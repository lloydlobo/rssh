The program parses the command line arguments to get the utility to run and the cron expression (if provided), and then creates a Schedule value from the expression string. If the expression string is not provided, a default value is used, which runs the command every 10 seconds. If the expression string is invalid, the program prints a default values chart and an ASCII art illustration of the cron syntax, and returns an error message.!"],["gg","GitUi - Git GUI `gg` alias"],["go",""],["script",""]]};
